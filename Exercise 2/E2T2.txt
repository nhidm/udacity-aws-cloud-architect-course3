Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

### Vulnerabilities
1. Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user
2. MFA should be enabled for the root user
3. Security groups (WebAppSG, WebAppSG) should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22
4. VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
5. CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Add a hardware MFA device for the root user
2. Enable MFA for the root user
3. Remove the rule that allows access to port 22 in inbound rules of Security Groups
4. Create new Security Groups which will be limited traffic on the Security Groups to only allow traffic from specific sources or IP addresses.
