# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Disable SSH password authentication on EC2 instance
- Limit SSH access to specific IP addresses



# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Enable server-side encryption on the S3 buckets.
- Implement the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure that IAM roles assigned to instances only have the necessary access.
- Create an IAM policy that only allows the access required for specific tasks and assign this policy to the instance role.
